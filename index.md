## {aboutMe: 'Kristine delos Santos'}

Hello, I'm a Web Developer from Manila. Over 7 years in this industry, I have had a chance to work on a diversity of projects and wore many hats like being a Project Manager, UI/UX Designer, Tech Support Specialist, and Web Developer.

I have recently started learning Javascript and is ready to take it the next level. My goal is to sharpen my coding skills and have the opportunity to be part of a project that will allow me to put all of these into practice. 

When I'm not coding, I'm usually reading books on Productivity, Human Psychology, and Entrepreneurship, or playing catch with my dog (Kuchi).

Armed with my MacBook Air, I have set up my own office in my studio apartment with a revolving chair that was designed to boost creative thinking and keep me sane when my code doesn't work.
